# Notepad Application

A notepad application in Java is a simple text editor that allows users to create, edit, save, and open text documents. It provides a basic user interface where users can type and manipulate text, similar to the default Notepad application in Windows.

## Key features of a typical notepad application in Java may include:

# User Interface: 
The application should have a clean and intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to interact with the text editor easily.

# Text Editing: 
Users should be able to enter, delete, and modify text using standard keyboard operations and mouse interactions.

# File Operations: 
The application should support common file operations such as creating a new document, opening existing documents, and saving documents to the file system.

# Text Formatting: 
Basic text formatting options, such as font selection, font size, bold, italic, underline, and text alignment, may be provided.

# Cut, Copy, Paste: 
The standard cut, copy, and paste functionalities should be implemented to allow users to manipulate the text easily.

# Undo/Redo: 
The application should allow users to undo and redo their actions to revert changes.

# Find and Replace: 
Providing a find and replace feature enables users to search for specific text and replace it with another.

# Word Count: 
Displaying the word count of the document can be a useful feature for users.

# Printing: 
Users should have the option to print their documents directly from the application.

# Keyboard Shortcuts: 
Implementing keyboard shortcuts for common operations can enhance user productivity.

To create a notepad application in Java, you would typically use Java Swing or JavaFX to build the GUI and handle user interactions. The text manipulation and file operations can be accomplished using Java's standard I/O classes.
